# GrApps Map
## An interactive web map about Appalachian Pro Wrestling
From the time I was a little kid, I have loved all things professional wrestling. When I started my Master's in Appalachian Studies, I found myself looking at regionally-specific folklore, folklife, and culture. I ended up circling back to professional wrestling, but this time looking at the local/regional level instead of what's on national TV every week. From my research into Appalachian pro wrestling, the GrApp Map is born.
### GrApp Map Data
Data has been extrapolated and modified from the WrestleMap project, who have done an extensive and great job mapping all the global wrestling promotions for fans to explore. Some wrestling promotions were independently added and researched by me as well. 
#### Hopes for Use
The main goal of this web map is to create a more centralized database of all the active wrestling promotions in Appalachia. Ideally, fans in our region will use this map to find their local/regional promotions to attend!
##### Community Contributions Welcomed!
If you are from an area of Appalachia that has local/regional wrestling that is not already on the map, please email me at calebbrownmedia@gmail.com or contribute to the map's code yourself to add the promotion(s) missing!
